# Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather sensor

This is a sensor project for the Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather. It reads the values from a BME280 and capacitive soil moisture sensor using CircuitPython.

## Hardware

- Adafruit ESP32-S2 TFT Feather on a FeatherWing Terminal Block 
- Adafruit BME280, connected via the STEMMA QT connector
- Generic "Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2", "AOUT" connected to "D13" on the ESP32-S2 TFT Feather through the Terminal Block
- 3x INR18650-30Q batteries in parallel, connected to BAT on the Terminal Block
